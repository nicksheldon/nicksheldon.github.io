                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>I am currently in my third year pursuing a Major in Computer Science and a Minor in Mathematics at Clarkson University, with an expected graduation date of December 2025.</p>

                <p>With a strong foundation in languages such as C, 
                    C++, x86 Assembly, Java, and Haskell, I am eager to apply my skills 
                    to real-world problems. At Clarkson, I have excelled in courses such as 
                    Computer Organization, Data Structures & Algorithms, Computer Vision, 
                    and Artificial Intelligence. I am particularly interested in developing 
                    my skills with low-level languages and AI.</p>
