                <p>I am a third year Computer Science Major and Mathematics Minor at 
                    Clarkson University. With a strong foundation in languages such as C, 
                    C++, x86 Assembly, Java, and Haskell, I am eager to apply my skills 
                    to real-world problems. At Clarkson, I have excelled in courses such as 
                    Computer Organization, Data Structures & Algorithms, Computer Vision, 
                    and Artificial Intelligence. I am particularly interested in developing 
                    my skills with low-level languages and AI.</p>
