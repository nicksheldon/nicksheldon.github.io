            <h2>Bio</h2>
            <p>I am a third year Computer Science Major and Mathematics Minor at 
                Clarkson University. With a strong foundation in languages such as C, 
                C++, x86 Assembly, Java, and Haskell, I am eager to apply my skills 
                to real-world problems. At Clarkson, I have excelled in courses such as 
                Computer Organization, Data Structures & Algorithms, Computer Vision, 
                and Artificial Intelligence. I am particularly interested in developing 
                my skills with low-level languages and AI.</p>
